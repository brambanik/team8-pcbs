# Team 8 PCB Repository
PCBs Designed by Bram Banik 

### A repository containing all the PCBs for Team 8's Robot Summer autonomous pet-retrieving robot. Includes:
#### Switch Debouncing Unit
#### Motherboard
#### Powerboard w/ 2 Buck Converters
#### H-Bridge
- *While the schematic for the H-Bridge is correct, physical testing  determined that the layout may cause failure to operate. The most likely cause is some sort of ground lift triggering the timer pin, which is currently being used out of spec*

*Many of the footprints in these PCBs were developed by another team, specifically @gsleen in the repository gs-kicad-lib*
